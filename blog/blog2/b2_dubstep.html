    <h3>Pegboard Nerds - "Here It Comes" (2014)</h3> <br>
    <p>Experiencing since Elementary School ~ 2013</p>

    <p> My journey with electronic music was kick started by a Buzzfeed video from the early 2010s.
        I'm sure my teenager brain was eating up the video content, but what really kept me watching
        was the sick, banging, trippy soundtrack. The first electronic song that stuck with me was "Lunaris"
        by Kynaze. 
    </p>

    <p>
        You have the snare beat with the slightest bit of reverb that tugs at your heart 
        each time it hits, and so many layers upon layers that all just fit so perfectly together. 
        The song is genuinely like a rollercoaster slowly building you up, then 
        letting you rest before taking you on a Mario Kart rainbow road, galactic audio trip. 
        The song takes the listener epic adventure through a fantasy forest with 
        the soft glow of fireflies dotting your path, then slowly an glistening door to
        the universe reveals itself. Suddenly, you're flying through space, multitudes 
        of stars zip past you, you see supernova remnants from stars that exploded centuries ago, 
        and you feel weightless as you soak in the experiene that is "Lunaris".   
    </p>

    <p>
        I remember walking to middle school listening "Lunaris". In particular, one morning
        of 8th grade it was like 7 am during autumn. So my path to school was solely illuminated by the dim 
        street lights that fizzled out into the blue tinted darkness. I felt at peace pacing through
        the crisp yet dewy fallen leaves feeling the trickles of Seattle rain as Kynaze accompanied me 
        through the serene promenade to school.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Lunaris" truly spoiled me, it is such a wonderful song to this day. It 
        introduced me to the world of dubstep and EDM, and my life has never been the same.
        I don't know about others, but music changes my mood, music is like a friend, and
        it inspires me to seek out my passions in life. I think my relationship with music
        genuinely has defined my personality, and how I interact with people in my life. For 
        EDM and dubstep, I feel powerful, and I feel like I can take on anything that comes 
        my way.
    </p>

    <p>
        After Kynaze, I listened to everything from Tobu, Nitro Fun, Vicetone, Zedd, 
        Audien, Approaching Nirvana and more. As a young middle school, my neurons were having daily parties
        from intaking pure dopamine in the form of sharp beats paired with upbeat electric
        melodies. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, I had few friends in elementary, middle, and even high school that 
        shared my love for dubstep and EDM. I even struggle to think of anyone in my life
        who knows that knows how much EDM and dubstep besides my friend Zack Sussman. As a 
        tween and teen, I remember trying to chain my Youtube recommended videos to hide my
        EDM and dubstep preferences as well as going through my soundcloud and unliking all
        my songs. Now, when I try to find my old songs to reminisce, they're all gone. And
        that makes me so sad. I wish I told old me that it was perfectly fine to enjoy EDM
        and dubstep, and there was nothing to be ashamed about. 
    </p>

    <p>
        This is a whole other conversation, but I'm starting to fully enjoy my past hobbies 
        and interests like anime, dubstep, and EDM. My philosophy is that I will not hold 
        back from interests that actively contribute to my happiness since I'm not hurting 
        anybody or myself. There is strictly a positive expected value for me listening to 
        the music I want to. 
    </p>

    <p>
        And what if someone judges me for my music taste? That is ok. Now I know
        I probably won't prefer to be around them, and I can just stick to the people who
        I can share my musical taste with!
    </p>

    <p>
        I remember in freshman year of college I talked to Zack about EDM a couple times here
        and there, and we've started talking about it more as I slowly rediscover all the songs
        I used to enjoy so much. I have a playlist on soundcloud and spotify to keep track of
        the rediscovered songs.
