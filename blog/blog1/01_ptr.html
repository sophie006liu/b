    <p> I saw peach tree rascals in concert today! </p>

    <center><h2>absolute banger</h2></center>

    <p>I got lucky and won VIP tickets so I could sit in the front row. I basically 
      got to sing with them. I never thought I would be able to experience this;
      It's like singing your favorite songs but with the person who wrote the song!
      Seeing them smile as i sang along with them was amazing! These songs I have connected 
      to, felt comfort in, and experienced my life with, felt completely different when
      the creator of the song allowed me to experience the auditory journey with them. 
    </p>

    <p>  I don't think I have been happier in this semester. As I am editing this one month later,
      I can say this is still true. That concert was a once in a lifetime experience, when I listen 
      to their songs now, I remember the concert, singing along with them, and I feel another level
      of connection to the songs.
    </p>

    <p> 
      I first found out about PTR during quarantine when I was listening to new music on Youtube. Then,
      I started listening to more and mroe of their songs like Violet, Summa, Ultra, Plus, Cranberry,
      Water, and Glide. I went through a lot mentally during quarantine but listening to their songs
      helped me relax and take a step back from everything.

      On another note, Tarrek followed me on insta which is UNREAL. He is my only follower, 
      and I plan to keep it that way.
